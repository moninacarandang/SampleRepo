I THINK that I shall never see	 
A poem lovely as a tree.	 
  
A tree whose hungry mouth is prest	 
Against the sweet earth's flowing breast;	 
  
A tree that looks at God all day,	         5
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;	 
  
A tree that may in summer wear	 
A nest of robins in her hair;	 
  
Upon whose bosom snow has lain;	 
Who intimately lives with rain.	  10
  
Poems are made by fools like me,	 
But only God can make a tree.
